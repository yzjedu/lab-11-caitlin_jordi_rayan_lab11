- The objective of this lab was to understand using a dictionary and how to apply it to other files. The steps we followed for this lab were creating an algorithm, writing the code, and making sure the code worked and successfully translated our files. The key concept explored in this lab was using dictionaries. Our results did match what we expected to get because the code translated the files the way it was supposed to. The main problem we faced was figuring out how to format our functions. we overcame this challeneg by figuring out what parts of the functions worled and what parts didnt. Ilearned what we were supposed to learn because now i have a better understanding of what dictionaries can do. I liked working with my partners because we worked well together.
